# MX Gemmini layout prototype

This out-of-tree compiler prototype is scoped to
`GemminiMxFPConfigs.standaloneMxFPConfig` at Gemmini
`f0167390b56fb315deea90ac1fc3983772e92d82` and MxGen
`a27ce3cd81513210c21f971ec3977defd13fa21e`. It carries an explicitly
selectable Merlin support provider with an empty executable capability claim.
It has no runtime backend, matrix lowering, oracle, or certified fact bundle.
Its layout rules are source-derived; one narrow payload-to-RTL diagnostic is
described below. Other shapes and the command stream remain unreviewed.

`mx_gemmini_support.layout` implements:

- `CONFIG_EX` activation/weight format codes;
- DIM16 logical scale-row ordering and format-specific physical bank address
  decoding;
- first-buffer E8M0 scale payloads and funct-27 `rs2`;
- capacity-bounded K-wave partitioning and zero-based scale payload slicing;
- conversion of logical E8M0 scale matrices from activation [M][K/32] and
  weight [N][K/32] or [K/32][N] into those wave payloads;
- `CONFIG_SCALE_MEM` `rs1` bitfield encoding;
- FP6 E3M2 codebook bit packing, 8-byte DMA padding, and funct-29 `rs2`;
- exact FP6 code-to-index mapping for supplied 16-entry codebooks, plus the
  activation and weight nibble layouts used by the selected DIM16 loop;
- direct FP8 byte layout and direct FP4 nibble layout for logical A[M][K]
  and B[K][N] operands;
- a contraction payload builder that checks operand and scale shapes together
  and slices both into matching K waves for all three formats.

Each planned wave fits the first 4 KiB active window for both operands and
the 9-bit `CONFIG_SCALE_MEM` K bound. This is a layout/capacity plan only:
the caller still must order scale uploads, configure the wave's loop bounds,
execute the corresponding operand tiles, and preserve the BF16 accumulator
across K waves. The pinned `ScaleFactorMem` counters wrap after a complete
configured loop; rs1 bit 62 resets requantizer counters but is not wired to
the scale read counters. Correct command scheduling and K-wave arithmetic
still require matching RTL simulator evidence. No larger contraction is
claimed executable by this prototype.

The packer refuses payloads above one active window. A compiler must
schedule additional uploads and choose scale banks for larger contractions;
that scheduling and all MX arithmetic lowering remain open.
The FP6 transform currently accepts one configured spatial window of at most
128 rows and columns, in multiples of 32. It requires every element code to
appear in its assigned codebook line. Choosing codebooks or approximating
missing codes is a numerical policy outside this compiler layout prototype.
Larger spatial dimensions require further tiling and LUT reload scheduling.
The selected RTL's `MX_LOAD_LUT` DMA reads through the next 8-byte boundary,
so callers must use the padded result as the actual source buffer.

model2MLIR's `linear_contraction_operands` returns the logical code and E8M0
scale tensors in this builder's expected orientations for a rank-2 Linear.
An isolated cross-repository check passed one 32x64x32 site through all three
formats; FP6 used caller-supplied exact codebooks. This checks representation
compatibility only.

A separate source-bound RTL diagnostic ran one FP8 32x32x32 contraction using
this package's packed activation, weight, and E8M0 buffers. It used distinct
values in the upper and lower activation rows and left and right weight
columns; all four BF16 output quadrants matched exactly and the simulator
exited zero. The command sequence was hand-written for that diagnostic.
This establishes one payload-to-RTL path, not an executable provider, a
general DMA/loop schedule, or FP4/FP6 payload qualification.

Run `python -m pytest tests -q` from this directory.

To inspect the provider through Merlin, set `MERLIN_TARGET_PATH` to this
directory and resolve `mx_gemmini`. This selects its metadata only; no
compiler execution is enabled by selection.
